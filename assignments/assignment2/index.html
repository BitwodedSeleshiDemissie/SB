  <h3>Image Crawler Fork-Join Pool App (Assignment 2 Final Submission)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
    Java 8 functional programming features together with Java 8
    sequential streams and their integration with the Java fork-join
    pool framework.  In particular, in this assignment you'll improve
    the implementation of the app from Assignments 2a and 2b that uses
    the Java fork-join pool framework to obtain, store, and transform
    images.  </p>

  <p> Like Assignments 2a and 2b, the code you'll write here will have
    GUI and will run as an app. Please use this GUI along with the
    JUnit tests discussed below to help test and debug your
    solution. </p>

  <h4>Overview of the Assignment 2b</h4>

  <p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.
    Your efforts will focus on the following tasks:

  <UL>

    <LI> Implement the methods in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/UnsynchronizedArray.java</CODE>
    file.  The bulk of the methods in this class can be copied from
    your <CODE>Array.java</CODE> implementation from previous
    assignments.  However, there are a few changes.  For example, the
    latest <CODE>Array.java</CODE> file has been converted from a
    class into an interface to enhance flexibility.  You'll therefore
    find it necessary to implement and use several new accessor
    methods for various fields previously defined in the <CODE>Array</CODE> class.<P>

    <LI> Complete the collector implementation in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/ArrayCollector.java</CODE>
    file.  Graduate students must implement the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/SynchronizedArray</CODE>
    class implementation and use it in their
    <CODE>ArrayCollector.java</CODE> implementation. Undergraduate
    students can ignore the <CODE>SynchronizedArray</CODE> class and
    use the <CODE>UnsynchronizedArray</CODE> class.<P>

    <LI> Complete the image crawler class implementation in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinCrawler1.java</CODE>
    and
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinCrawler2.java</CODE>
    files, which uses the Java fork-join pool framework to perform an
    "image crawl" starting from a root Uri.  All students must use
    Java 8 lambda expressions, method references, and sequential
    streams for their <CODE>ForkJoinCrawler2.java</CODE>
    implementation. <P>

    <LI> Undergraduates will need to implement the
    <CODE>ArraySpliterator</CODE> in <CODE>UnsynchronizedArray</CODE>
    (graduate students did this as part of a previous assignment).
  </UL>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available
    at <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment2/">this
    link</a> in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup
    your <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you
    can pull this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully,
    and complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>JUnit Tests</h4>

  <p> Extensive JUnit tests in the
  <code>image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler</code>
  folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
  implementation is working as expected.  You can run all the unit
  tests by right-clicking on <CODE>crawlers</CODE> and
  <CODE>utils</CODE> in this folder and running them. </p>

  <p> If you need help learning how to use the Android Studio GUI to
  run the JUnit tests locally on your computer please see <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>
  and/or ask questions.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the
  presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on the
  JUnit tests to detect problems in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Additional Resources</h4>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul> 

  <li>Videos that present a detailed overview of the Java fork-join
    framework are available in weeks 4 and 5 of my <A
    HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs891f/">CS 891 class
    website</A>. <p>

  <li>Videos that present a detailed overview of the Java 8 sequential
    streams framework are available in weeks 5 and 6 of my <A
    HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs891f/">CS 891 class
    website</A>. <p>

  <li>Good overviews of the Java fork-join pool appear <A
  HREF="https://www.infoq.com/interviews/doug-lea-fork-join">here</A>
  and <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/fork-join-422606.html">here</A>.
</li>
</ul>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    <p> Assignments 2a and 2b are designed to give you experience
    programming directly to the Java fork-join pool framework APIs
    using Java 8 features, including lambda expressions, method
    references, and sequential streams.  The app, image crawler
    skeletons, and JUnit tests are extensive, though you don't need to
    understand them all to complete your solution. </p>

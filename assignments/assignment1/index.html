  <h3>Array (Assignment 1 Final Submission)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deeper your experience using
    Android Studio to develop and test a Java Array class written
    using Java 8 functional programming features, such as functional
    interfaces.  Although we'll be using Android Studio, the code
    you'll write for this assignment will not have GUI and will not
    run as an app.  It's important that your Array implementation work
    properly since it's required by all subsequent assignments in this
    course, including the ones that <em>are</em> Android apps.  </p>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <p>
    Before you complete Assignment 1 you'll need to do the following things:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li> Integrate your solution into the new skeletons, which will
    require some minor changes to the
    <CODE>ArrayIterator.next()</CODE> method to throw
    <CODE>NoSuchElementException</CODE>. Also, note that there's no
    more <CODE>ugrad</CODE> vs. <CODE>grad</CODE> folders, i.e.,
    everything is in a single directory structure.</li> <P>

    <li> Update your assignment 1a and 1b solutions to address my
    comments, as well as ensuring that you've address any other
    relevant comments from the ``frequently made mistakes'' videos
    I've posted to my <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp5ZOxpx_RVkkktBMd0S5B6Q">youtube
    playlist</A>. </li> <P>

    <li> Ensure that your integrated solution passes the
    latest/greatest automated unit tests (see below) that are part of
    the assignment 1 final submission project. </li> <P>

  </ul>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment1/">here</a>
    in my GitHub account.  Once you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  Please note that you'll need to
    complete the "TODO" markers in both the <CODE>Array.java</CODE>
    and <CODE>Assignment.java</CODE> files this time. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> JUnit unit tests in the
  <code>app/src/test/java/edu/vandy/imagecrawler</code> folder are
  provided to increase our confidence that your implementation is
  working as expected.  You'll need to learn how to use the Android
  Studio GUI to run the JUnit test locally on your computer, as
  described <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
  As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
  absence, so don't rely solely on the JUnit tests to detect problems
  in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    This assignment is intentionally designed to be easy to help you
    get familiar with installing/using Java and Android Studio, as
    well as some basic Java 8 functional programming features.  If you
    find it's extremely hard to complete this assignment you may not
    be ready to take this class.  If this is the case, please meet
    with me ASAP to discuss your options. <p>

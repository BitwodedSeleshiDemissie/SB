  <h3>Array (Assignment 1a)</h3>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <p>
    Before you start with Assignment 1a you'll need to do the following
    things:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Download and install Android Studio. Instructions for
      doing this are available <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/wiki/Installing-Software">here</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      Setup an account on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, which is also explained <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/wiki/Installing-Software">here</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Overview of the Array Assignment</h4>

  <p> The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using
    Android Studio to develop and test a Java Array class.  An Array
    is an abstract data type (ADT) implemented via a single contiguous
    buffer that provides operations like get(), set(), add(),
    remove(), and size(). Your task is to implement a generic Array
    class in Java.  This class will be different from Java built-in
    arrays in various ways, e.g., it can be resized and used in
    conjunction with other Java Collection Framework classes. </p>

    <p> Graduate students (or
    students who are taking this course for graduate credit) must do
    the following additional work: </p> 

    <ul> <li>Implement the requirements of the <a
    href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html">Iterator</a>
    interface.

  </ul>

  <p>
    As much as possible, you should avoid using loops in this assignment and instead try to use <CODE>Arrays.copyOf()</CODE> (this isn't always possible, of course).
  </p>

  <p>
    The following resources may be helpful in completing this assignment:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html">java.utils.Arrays documentation.</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/">The Oracle Java Tutorial</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p> If you're Java knowledge is rusty you might consider watching the videos in
  our Coursera <A
  HREF="https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-for-android/">Java for
  Android</A> MOOC. </p>

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p>
    Skeleton code for this assignment is available
    <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment1/">here</a>
    account.  Once you've setup your <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
    skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
    "TODO" markers.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are an undergraduate student please use the shells that are in
    the <code>ugrad</code> directory at the URL above.  If you are a
    graduate student please use the shells that are in the
    <code>grad</code> directory at the URL above.
  </p>

  <p> There are JUnit unit tests that you should run to increase your
  confidence that your implementation is working as expected.  As
  usual, testing only provides the presence of bugs, not their
  absence, so don't rely solely on the JUnit tests to detect problems
  in your code. </p>

  <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
  <p>
    This assignment is intentionally designed to be easy to help you get
    familiar with installing/using Java and Android Studio.  If you find it
    extremely hard to complete this assignment you may not be ready to
    take this class.  If this is the case, please meet with me ASAP to
    discuss.

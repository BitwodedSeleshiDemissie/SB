  <h3>Image Crawler Stream App (Assignment 2a)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of the first part of this two-part assignment is to
    deepen your experience using Java 8 functional programming
    features and their integration with Java 8 sequential streams.  In
    particular, in this assignment you'll develop an app that uses the
    Java 8 streams framework to obtain and store images.</p>

  <p> Although we'll be using Android Studio, the code you'll write
    for this assignment will not have GUI and will not run as an app. </p>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <p> Before you complete the initial submission of Assignment 2a
    you'll need to do the following: </p>

  <ul>

    <li> Complete your implementation of <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment1b/">assignment
    1b</a>, taking into account my review comments.  In particular,
    it's important that your Array implementation works properly since
    it's used as the basis for the app in this assignment.  Please
    come to office hours if you have any questions about assignment 1. </li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Overview of the Assignment 2a</h4>

  <p> In this part of the assignment you'll complete the
  implementation of an image crawler class in the
  <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/crawlers/SequentialStreamsCrawler.java</CODE>
  file that obtains and stores images.  This class uses Java 8
  sequential streams to perform an "image crawl" starting from a root
  Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the tests, images from
  HTML page reachable from the root Uri are either downloaded from a
  remote web server or read from the local file system and the results
  are stored in files. </p>

  <p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.
    In fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features provided in the
    <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</CODE>
    file.  Your will therefore focus on converting this Java 7-based
    class to the <CODE>SequentialStreamsCrawler</CODE> class that uses
    Java 8 sequential streams.</p>

    <p> Undergraduate students must do the following additional work: </p>

    <ul> <li>Implement the key methods in the <a
    href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Spliterator.html">Spliterator</a>
    interface in the
    <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/utils/Array.java</CODE>
    class (which was done by graduate students in assignment 1b).
    You'll need these methods for assignment 2b. </ul>

    <p> Likewise, graduate students (or students who are taking this
    course for graduate credit) must do the following additional work:
    </p>

    <ul> <li>Complete the implementation of the class in the
    <CODE>app/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/utils/ArrayCollector.java</CODE>
    file and use it in the implementation of the
    <CODE>crawlHyperLinksOnPage()</CODE> method.  Undergraduates can
    optionally implement the <CODE>ArrayCollector</CODE> class or use
    a different implementation (e.g., a forEach() loop).

  </ul>

  <p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops in this assignment
    and instead use Java 8 sequential stream aggregate operations.
    </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment2a/">here</a>
    in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> JUnit unit tests in the
  <code>app/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler</code>
  folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
  implementation is working as expected.  You can run all the unit
  tests by right-clicking on 'AllTests' in this folder.  If you need
  help learning how to use the Android Studio GUI to run the JUnit
  test locally on your computer please see <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>
  and/or ask questions.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the
  presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on the
  JUnit tests to detect problems in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Additional Resources</h4>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul> 

  <li>A video that gives a pithy overview of Java 8 sequential streams
    is available <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_jZLi0XZts&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=54&t=147s">here</a>.
    Naturally, we'll cover this material in class, which will be
    available in my YouTube CS891 playlist <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6aIJ8c6sxI8jakvub-vQxb">here</A>.</li>
    <p>

  <li>Good overviews of Java 8 streams appear <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html">here</A>
  and <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/architect-streams-pt2-2227132.html">here</A>.
  I highly recommend you get the book <A
  HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/java-8-in-action">Java 8 in
  Action</A> to learn more about Java 8 streams programming. </li>  
</ul>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    <p> Assignment 2a is more complicated than assignment 1 and is
    designed to deepen your experience developing apps using Java 8
    functional programming features and Java 8 sequential streams.  In
    particular, the skeletons and JUnit tests are much more extensive,
    though you don't need to understand them all to complete your
    solution.  Therefore, please make sure you start early and ask
    questions in class, office hours, and on the discussion
    forums. </p>

    <p> Assignment 2b will extend the sequential solution you
    implement for 2a to support Java 8 parallel streams. <p>

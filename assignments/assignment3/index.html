  <h3>Image Crawler Parallel Stream App (Assignment 3)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
    Java 8 functional programming features and their integration with
    Java 8 parallel streams.  In particular, in this assignment you'll
    develop an app that uses the Java 8 streams framework to obtain,
    transform, and store images.</p>

  <h4>Overview of the Assignment 3</h4>

  <p> In this part of the assignment you'll complete the
  implementation of an image crawler class in the
  <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ParallelStreamsCrawler.java</CODE>
  file that obtains, processes, and stores images.  This class uses
  Java 8 parallel streams to perform an "image crawl" starting from a
  root Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the tests, images
  from HTML page reachable from the root Uri are either downloaded
  from a remote web server or read from the local file system and the
  results are stored in files. </p>

  <p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.
    In fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features provided in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</CODE>
    file.  Your will therefore focus on converting this Java 7-based
    class to the <CODE>ParallelStreamsCrawler</CODE> class that uses
    Java 8 parallel streams. </p>

    <p> Everyone taking the course (i.e., both ugrads and grads) must
    also complete implementations of all the methods in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/ArrayCollector.java</CODE>,
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/UnsynchronizedArray.java</CODE>,
    and
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/SynchronizedArray.java</CODE>
    files.  </p> </ul>

  <p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops in this assignment
    and instead use Java 8 parallel stream aggregate operations.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment3/">here</a>
    in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> The JUnit unit tests in the
  <code>image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler</code>
  folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
  implementation is working as expected.    You can run all the unit
  tests by right-clicking on <CODE>crawlers</CODE> and
  <CODE>utils</CODE> in this folder and running them. </p>

  <p> If you need help learning how to use the Android Studio GUI to
  run the JUnit test locally on your computer please see <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>
  and/or ask questions.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the
  presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on the
  JUnit tests to detect problems in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Additional Resources</h4>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul> 

  <li>Videos that present a detailed overview of the Java 8 parallel
    streams framework are available in weeks 7, 8, 9, and 10 of my <A
    HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs891f/">CS 891 class
    website</A>. <p>

  <li>Good overviews of Java 8 sequential and parallel streams appear
  <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html">here</A>
  and <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/architect-streams-pt2-2227132.html">here</A>.
  I highly recommend you get the book <A
  HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/java-8-in-action">Java 8 in
  Action</A> to learn more about Java 8 streams programming. </li>
  </ul>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    <p> Once you've got Assignment 2 working properly (and address all
    my reviewer comments) it should be relatively straightforward to
    implement Assignment 3.  This assignment is designed to deepen
    your experience developing apps using Java 8 functional
    programming features and Java 8 parallel streams
    <CODE>without</CODE> the need to program the fork-join thread pool
    directly.  The skeletons and JUnit tests are extensive, though you
    don't need to understand them all to complete your solution.
    Please ask questions in class, office hours, and on the discussion
    forums. </p>

  <h3>Array (Assignment 1b)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deeper your experience using
    Android Studio to develop and test a Java Array class written
    using Java 8 functional programming features, such as functional
    interfaces.  Although we'll be using Android Studio, the code
    you'll write for this assignment will not have GUI and will not
    run as an app.  It's important that your Array implementation work
    properly since it's required by all subsequent assignments in this
    course, including the ones that <em>are</em> Android apps.  </p>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <p>
    Before you start with Assignment 1b you'll need to do the following things:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Make sure that you've installed Java 8.  Instructions for
      doing this are available <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/wiki/Installing-Software">here</a>. </li>

    <li> Complete your implementation of <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment1a/">assignment
    1a</a>.  
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>Once you get my comments back your assignment 1a submission make
  sure to incorporate any changes into your assignment 1b solution.</p>

  <h4>Overview of the Array Assignment</h4>

  <p> An Array is an abstract data type (ADT) implemented via a single
    contiguous buffer that provides operations like get(), set(),
    add(), remove(), and size().  This class differs from Java
    built-in arrays in various ways, e.g., it can be resized and used
    in conjunction with other Java Collection Framework classes.  Your
    task in Assignment 1b is to implement a generic Array class in
    Java that includes methods (such as replaceAll() and forEach())
    using Java 8 features, such as functional interfaces.</p>

    <p> Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for
    graduate credit) must do the following additional work: </p>

    <ul> <li>Implement the requirements of the <a
    href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Spliterator.html">Spliterator</a>
    interface.  Please see the videos <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D14w0L5WdSQ&t=7s&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6aIJ8c6sxI8jakvub-vQxb&index=20">here</A> and <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJzz9HARwpg&t=124s&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp6aIJ8c6sxI8jakvub-vQxb&index=24">here</a> for more information on Java Spliterators.
  </ul>

  <p> As much as possible, you should avoid using loops in this
    assignment and instead try to use <CODE>Arrays.copyOf()</CODE>
    and/or <CODE>System.arraycopy()</CODE>
    (this isn't possible for all parts of the code, of course).  </p>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul> <li><a
    href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html">java.utils.Arrays
    documentation.</a></li> <li><a

    Tutorial</a></li> </ul>

  <p> If you're Java knowledge is rusty you might consider watching
  the videos in our Coursera <A

  Android</A> MOOC. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment1b/">here</a>
    in my GitHub account.  Once you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <p> If you are an undergraduate student please use the shells that
    are in the <A HREF="ugrad">ugrad</A> directory at the URL above.
    If you are a graduate student please use the shells that are in
    the <A HREF="grad">grad</A> directory at the URL above.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> JUnit unit tests in the
  <code>app/src/test/java/edu/vandy/imagecrawler</code> folder are
  provided to increase our confidence that your implementation is
  working as expected.  You'll need to learn how to use the Android
  Studio GUI to run the JUnit test locally on your computer, as
  described <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
  As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
  absence, so don't rely solely on the JUnit tests to detect problems
  in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    This assignment is intentionally designed to be easy to help you
    get familiar with installing/using Java and Android Studio, as
    well as some basic Java 8 functional programming features.  If you
    find it's extremely hard to complete this assignment you may not
    be ready to take this class.  If this is the case, please meet
    with me ASAP to discuss your options. <p>

  <h3>Image Crawler Completable Future App (Assignment 4)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
    Java 8 functional programming features and their integration with
    Java 8 completable futures.  In particular, in this assignment
    you'll develop an app that uses the Java 8 completable futures
    framework to obtain, store, and transform images.</p>

  <p> The code you'll write for this assignment will have GUI and will
    run as an app.  Feel free to use the GUI to help debug your
    code. </p>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <hr width=50% align=left>
  <h4>Overview of the Assignment 4</h4>

  <p> In this part of the assignment you'll complete the
  implementation of an image crawler class in the
  <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/CompletableFutureCrawler1.java</CODE>
  file that obtains, stores, and transforms images.  This class uses
  Java 8 completable futures to perform an "image crawl" starting from
  a root Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the tests,
  images from HTML page reachable from the root Uri are either
  downloaded from a remote web server or read from the local file
  system and the results are stored in files.  You can also
  enable/disble transforms via the GUI. </p>

  <p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.
    In fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features provided in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</CODE>
    file.  Your will therefore focus on converting this Java 7-based
    class to the <CODE>CompletableFutureCrawler1</CODE> class that
    uses Java 8 completable futures. </p>

    <p> Everyone taking the course (i.e., both ugrads and grads) must
    also complete implementations of all the methods in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/ArrayCollector.java</CODE>,
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/UnsynchronizedArray.java</CODE>,
    and
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/SynchronizedArray.java</CODE>
    files.  </p> </ul>

  </ul>

  <p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops in this assignment
    and instead use Java 8 completable future methods.
    </p>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment4/">here</a>
    in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> The initial release of the assignment 4 project does not contain
  unit tests.  We'll add them shortly.</p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Additional Resources</h4>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul> 

  <li>Videos that give a detailed overview of Java 8 completable
    futures are available in Weeks 11, 12, and 13 of the CS 891 videos
    <a
    href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs891f">here</a>. <p>

  <li>Other good overviews of Java 8 completable futures appear <A
  HREF="http://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture">here</A> and
  <A
  HREF="http://www.nurkiewicz.com/2013/05/java-8-definitive-guide-to.html">here</A>.
  I highly recommend you get the book <A
  HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/java-8-in-action">Java 8 in
  Action</A> to learn more about Java 8 completable futures. </li>
  </ul>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    <p> Assignment 4 is more complicated than the previous
    assignments, so please start the assignment soon and ask questions
    in class, office hours, and on the discussion forums. </p>

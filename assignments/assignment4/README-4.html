  <h3>Image Crawler Completable Future App (Assignment 4)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
    Java 8 functional programming features and their integration with
    Java 8 completable futures.  In particular, in this assignment
    you'll develop an app that uses the Java 8 completable futures
    framework to obtain and store images.</p>

  <p> Like the earlier assignments, the code you'll write here will
    have GUI and will run as an Android app. Please use this GUI along
    with the JUnit tests discussed below to help test and debug your
    solution. </p>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <hr width=50% align=left>
  <h4>Overview of the Assignment 4</h4>

  <p> In this part of the assignment you'll complete the
  implementation of an image crawler class in the
  <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/CompletableFutureCrawler.java</CODE>
  file that obtains and stores images.  This class uses Java 8
  completable futures to perform an "image crawl" starting from a root
  Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the tests, images from
  HTML page reachable from the root Uri are either downloaded from a
  remote web server or read from the local file system and the results
  are stored in files. </p>

  <p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.
    In fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features provided in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</CODE>
    file.  Your will therefore focus on converting this Java 7-based
    class to the <CODE>CompletableFutureCrawler</CODE> class that uses
    Java 8 completable futures. <EM> This
    <CODE>SequentialLoopsCrawler</CODE> implementation differs
    somewhat from the version provided in previous assignments, so
    you'll need to revise portions of your Java 8 solution from
    earlier assignments to account for these changes.</EM></p>

    <p> Everyone taking the course (i.e., both ugrads and grads) must
    also include your completed implementations of all the methods in
    the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/ArrayCollector.java</CODE>
    and
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/Array.java</CODE>
    files.  </p>

  </ul>

  <p> Your solution should use <EM>no</EM> loops in this assignment
    and instead use Java 8 completable future methods.
    </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment4/">here</a>
    in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> JUnit unit tests in the
  <code>image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler</code>
  folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
  implementation is working as expected.  You'll need to learn how to
  use the Android Studio GUI to run the JUnit test locally on your
  computer, as described <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>.
  As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
  absence, so don't rely solely on the JUnit tests to detect problems
  in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Additional Resources</h4>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul> 

  <li>Detailed overviews of Java 8 completable futures are available
    in videos 57 thru 64 in one of my <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp5ZOxpx_RVkkktBMd0S5B6Q">YouTube
    playlists</a>.  </li> <p>

  <li>Good overviews of Java 8 completable futures appear <A
  HREF="http://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture">here</A>
  and <A
  HREF="http://www.nurkiewicz.com/2013/05/java-8-definitive-guide-to.html">here</A>.
  I highly recommend you get the book <A
  HREF="https://www.manning.com/books/java-8-in-action">Java 8 in
  Action</A> to learn more about Java 8 completable futures. </li>  
</ul>

    Naturally, we'll cover all this material in class, which will
    be available in my YouTube CS891 playlist <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp5NbV2NQ2moSX-V_Jv1aiGH">here</A>.

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    <p> Assignment 4 is more complicated than the previous
    assignments.  In particular, the asynchronous nature of
    completable futures may take some time to get accustomed to, so
    please start the assignment soon and ask questions in class,
    office hours, and on the discussion forums.  As usual, the app,
    image crawler skeletons, and JUnit tests are extensive, though you
    don't need to understand them all to complete your solution. </p>

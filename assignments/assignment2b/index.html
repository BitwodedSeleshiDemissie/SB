  <h3>Image Crawler Fork-Join Pool App (Assignment 2b)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
    Java 8 functional programming features together with Java 8
    sequential streams and their integration with the Java fork-join
    pool.  In particular, in this assignment you'll improve the
    implementation of the app from Assignment 2a that uses the Java
    fork-join pool framework to obtain, store, and transform
    images.  </p>

  <p> Like assignment 1, the code you'll write for this assignment
    will have GUI and will run as an app. Please use this GUI along
    with the unit tests to help test and debug your solution. </p>

  <h4>Overview of the Assignment 2b</h4>

  <p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.
    Your efforts will focus on the following tasks:

  <UL>

    <LI> Implement the methods in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/UnsynchronizedArray.java</CODE>
    file.  The bulk of the methods in this class can be copied from
    your <CODE>Array.java</CODE> implementation from previous
    assignments.  Note that the latest <CODE>Array.java</CODE> file
    has been converted from a class into an interface to enhance
    flexibility. <P>

    <LI> Complete the collector implementation in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/ArrayCollector.java</CODE>
    file. <P>

    <LI> Graduate students must implement the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/SynchronizedArray</CODE>
    class implementation and use it in their
    <CODE>ArrayCollector.java</CODE> implementation. Undergraduate
    students can ignore the <CODE>SynchronizedArray</CODE> class.<P>

    <LI> Complete the image crawler class implementation in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinCrawler2.java</CODE>
    file to obtain, store, and transform images.  This class uses Java
    fork-join pool framework to perform an "image crawl" starting from
    a root Uri.  All students must use Java 8 lambda expressions,
    method references, and sequential streams for their
    <CODE>ForkJoinCrawler2.java</CODE> implementation. <P>

    <LI> Refactor certain portions of your
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinCrawler1.java</CODE>
    code from assignment 2a so we can auto-grade it accurately.
    Please read the comments carefully and make sure to put your code
    in the appropriate "graduate" vs. "undergraduate" branches.  

  </UL>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment2b/">here</a>
    in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> JUnit unit tests in the
  <code>image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler</code>
  folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
  implementation is working as expected.  You can run all the unit
  tests by right-clicking on 'assignmentTests' in this folder and
  running it. </p>

  <p> If you need help learning how to use the Android Studio GUI to
  run the JUnit test locally on your computer please see <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>
  and/or ask questions.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the
  presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on the
  JUnit tests to detect problems in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Additional Resources</h4>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul> 

  <li>Videos that present a detailed overview of the Java fork-join
    framework are available in weeks 4 and 5 of my <A
    HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs891f/">CS 891 class
    website</A>. <p>

  <li>Videos that present a detailed overview of the Java 8 sequential
    streams framework are available in weeks 5 and 6 of my <A
    HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs891f/">CS 891 class
    website</A>. <p>

  <li>Good overviews of the Java fork-join pool appear <A
  HREF="https://www.infoq.com/interviews/doug-lea-fork-join">here</A>
  and <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/fork-join-422606.html">here</A>.
</li>
</ul>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    <p> The fork-join pool framework in Assignment 2b is designed to
    give you experience programming directly to the Java fork-join
    pool framework APIs using Java 8 sequential streams.  There are
    more "moving parts" in this assignment compared with previous
    assignments.  Therefore, please start the assignment soon and ask
    questions in class, office hours, and on the discussion forums.
    The app, image crawler skeletons, and JUnit tests are extensive,
    though you don't need to understand them all to complete your
    solution. </p>
